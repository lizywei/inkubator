# INKubator Agentic Demo (NVIDIA AIQ Toolkit Hackathon)

> A local AI agent system to help writers publish ethically and creatively using NVIDIA tools.

---

##  Overview

This demo showcases a lightweight, three-agent architecture that:
-  Curates story submissions with suggested headlines, tags, and excerpts
-  Moderates for unsafe or policy-violating content
-  Simulates tipping and unlocks premium content for readers

All agents are powered by simple Python, NVIDIA’s AIQ Toolkit-compatible architecture, and run locally on an RTX 5880.
